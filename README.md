   clicking on your profile icon, _Security & privacy_, _Export E2E room keys_.

2.  Run with an optional directory to store output, e.g.: `./matrix-archive.py chats`

3. You'll be prompted to enter your homeserver, user credentials and the path
   to the room keys you downloaded in step 1.

   with a log of all messages will be written along with media and member
   avatars.

## sso
In case you are using a SSO infrastructure â€¦ you have to know the SSO redirectUrl for 
the service and may need to adjust the SSO login field names in get_sso_login_token()

```
--batch --all-rooms --sso <redirectUrl> --server <homeserver> --user <SSOUSER> 
--userpass <SSOPASS> --keys element-keys.txt --keyspass <KEYSPASS> /tmp/test-archive/ ```
